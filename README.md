# SmokeStack helper scripts

Helper scripts to help manage/use/maintain packages created by SmokeStack.

## RPM cache build scripts

Build an RPM repo from a SmokeStack package cache.

## diff scripts

Scripts to generate diff reports for distro packaging branches.

I use this to generate simple HTML reports which display diffs between
upstream SmokeStack packaging branches and downstream distro packaging.
